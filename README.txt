Endermanage Mod v1.0 - By FyberOptic (fyberoptic@gmail.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Endermanage allows you to control which blocks Endermen are allowed to pick up
and carry.  The config file allows three modes: pick up no blocks except the
ones specified, pick up the default blocks as well as the ones specified, or
pick up all blocks except for the ones specified.  

Individual blocks and block ranges can be specified, including mod block IDs.

Please note that some blocks, especially mod blocks, could have unexpected
results from being carried.  They may simply not render, or could potentially
even crash your game!

Remember that you can set your game to peaceful to temporarily remove all 
Endermen if necessary.

This mod was built using Forge #804 with SRG enabled for Minecraft 1.6.x
